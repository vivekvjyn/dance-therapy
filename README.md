# Dance Therapy

## Usage instructions

To use you can go to the deployed version [amalgah.net/dance-therapy/](https://amalgah.net/dance-therapy/)

Or if you wish to run the code locally, clone the repo and host index.html

### Running a Local HTTP Server

To serve the files locally, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server. In the cloned project directory, run:

```sh
# For Python 3.x
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

Alternatively, you can use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) if you have Node.js installed:

```sh
npx http-server
